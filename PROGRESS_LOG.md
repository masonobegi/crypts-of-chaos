# BUILD LOG — Chronic Care

> Append-only work log. **If you are a future session picking this up: read the
> "NEXT UP" section at the bottom, then `git log --oneline` to see where things stand.**

Engine: **Godot 4.3** (headless binary validated in-session; project opens in 4.3+).
Validation command:
```
$GODOT --headless --path . --script res://tests/run_tests.gd
```
where `$GODOT` is a Godot 4.3 linux binary (downloaded to the session scratchpad,
not committed — see docs/BUILDING.md).

## Session 1 — 2026-08-19

### Done
- [x] Wiped prior repo contents (owner request), started fresh.
- [x] Project skeleton: `project.godot`, input map, physics layers, `.gitignore`.

- [x] `docs/DESIGN.md` — critique of the brief + the five design changes made.
- [x] Autoloads: Log, RNG (seeded, per-stream), EventBus, DB (content), GameState,
      AudioMgr (fully procedural synthesis — zero audio assets), SaveSystem.
- [x] Core data model: WorldEvent (truth) / PatientChart (record) / Mind+Evidence
      (belief) / Patient / Complication.
- [x] Headless test harness + 118 passing assertions.

### Gotcha found (documented in docs/BUILDING.md)
`preload()` of scripts that reference many `class_name` types deadlocks the
GDScript loader when combined with typed signal params on an autoload. Fixed by
(a) untyping EventBus signal params and (b) using runtime `load()` in the runner.

- [x] Player controller (FPS, crouch, physics shove) + spring-based grab/throw.
- [x] Prop system, 25 items as data, procedural silhouettes, breakage, noise.
- [x] Procedural hospital: 12 rooms (corridor, 5 wards, lobby, nurses' station,
      treatment bay, supply, staff WC, office), two-tone walls with punched
      doorways, hinged physics doors, signage, lights, full furniture pass.
- [x] Custom A* NavGrid (not a baked NavMesh — needs to work headless and be
      seed-reproducible). Integration test proves every room is reachable.
- [x] Fixtures: treatment machines (dial + prescribed value + auditable log +
      invisible calibration sabotage), windows, light switches, EHR terminals,
      shredder, supply shelves, vitals consoles, patient beds (rigid bodies you
      can wheel down the corridor with someone still in them).
- [x] 279 assertions green.

### Gotchas found (both now guarded in the runner / documented)
1. `preload()` + typed autoload signals deadlocks the GDScript loader.
2. Adding a script with a new `class_name` leaves the global class cache stale
   until `--import` runs; run_tests.sh now always does an import pass first.
3. **Calling `.new()` on a script with parse errors HANGS the process** rather
   than erroring. run_tests.gd now gates every instantiation on
   `can_instantiate()`.

- [x] NPC layer: bodies, perception (FOV/LOS/hearing/attention), SuspicionSystem
      (witness routing, corroboration, gossip, complaints, institutional minds,
      statistical inference), Dialogue (barks + conversations with real odds).
- [x] Simulation: PatientSystem, TreatmentSystem, EconomySystem, RecordsSystem,
      InvestigationSystem (incl. covert/undercover), RandomEventSystem, Upgrades,
      Endings, ShiftSystem (full day loop).
- [x] UI: procedural toolkit + HUD + 13 screens (briefing, chart, records
      terminal, dialogue, chart review, shift report, upgrades, tablet, pause,
      tutorial, game over, vitals, treatment).
- [x] Game root wiring, Game.tscn, MainMenu.tscn with run seeds.
- [x] **Headless playthrough test** (`tests/smoke_run.gd`): boots the real scene,
      plays a full shift, exercises sabotage → complication → documentation →
      audit → billing → save/load → day rollover. 37 checks.
      **This caught two real bugs that compilation could not:**
      1. Spawning into `get_tree().current_scene`, which is null whenever the
         game is instantiated into the tree rather than loaded as the scene root
         — silently dropped every patient body and chart.
      2. A ternary that bound to `box_mesh()`'s argument instead of the whole
         expression, passing a Vector3 where a Mesh was expected (null mesh).
- [x] 314 assertions + 37 smoke checks, all green.

### Gotcha #4
Autoload singletons are NOT resolvable at compile time from a `--script` main
loop. `tests/smoke_run.gd` is a thin runner that `load()`s `smoke_impl.gd` at
runtime for exactly this reason.

- [x] Wired every upgrade effect into the systems that consume it (cameras
      create permanent institutional records, private rooms scale witness
      quality, retainer raises the investigation threshold, diagnostics bench
      de-noises vitals, coffee machine keeps nurses at the station, confidential
      waste contract normalises shredding).
- [x] Codex: learn-by-observation notes, unlocked after seeing an effect twice.
- [x] **Balance harness** (`tests/balance_sim.gd`) — three 16-day careers with
      asserted design intent. It found a design inversion nothing else could:
      with five beds, curing fast and refilling out-earned prolonging, so
      cheating paid LESS than honesty. Fixed with an admission cost + acuity
      escalation, so duration beats turnover. Also exposed that running a
      machine not indicated for a condition was completely invisible.
- [x] Sanction ladder now scales with heat past Probation, so a cleaned-up
      doctor gets room to recover but one at max heat does not.
- [x] Killed 155 spurious engine errors in the harness: nodes added during a
      SceneTree's `_initialize()` are NOT inside the tree, so every
      `global_position` read failed. Furniture now builds with local positions
      (order-independent), and the runner waits for a real frame.
- [x] README.

### Current numbers (seed 90210, 16 days)
| strategy | earned | ending | standing |
|---|---|---|---|
| honest   | $13,099 | Saint | Clean, rep 1.00, broke |
| careless | $12,301 | Struck off day 12 | heat 100% |
| careful  | $38,645 | Tycoon | Clean, rep 0.89 |

- [x] Investigators with bodies: they walk to each chart, nurse and machine in
      turn, so every step is interceptable. Covert ones still get no body.
- [x] Staff propositions: corrupt nurses name a price, loyal ones warn you,
      gossips tell you what's going around. Paying buys real silence and counts
      toward Medical Mafia; threatening backfires into fresh evidence.
- [x] Content: 19 conditions, 17 treatments, 14 complications, 19 random events.
      Added validation tests that walk ALL content and assert every condition has
      reachable treatments with real tools, every complication has real cause
      tags, and every machine treatment is indicated somewhere.
- [x] PA tannoy system — atmosphere that doubles as an institutional-mood signal.
- [x] Student-on-placement event (a witness with legs), agency nurse (owes you
      nothing), coffee machine failure (defeats the coffee upgrade), bed closure.
- [x] Remaining upgrade behaviours wired: service contract fixes AND reports
      miscalibration, ward clerk files your gaps but notices the pattern, second
      opinion policy puts a colleague through every extended stay.
- [x] 519 assertions, 37 smoke checks, 8 balance checks.

- [x] Tutorial: five objective beats through the legitimate job only. It never
      mentions the other thing — the player is taught what a good doctor does
      and handed a debt a good doctor cannot service.
- [x] Whistleblower is now an actual action (private terminal only), so all
      nine endings are reachable. Test walks every one and asserts it.
- [x] Second statistical signal: complication RATE, not just length of stay.
      Perfect paperwork is no defence against being an outlier. Two bugs found
      writing it — the denominator originally included still-admitted patients
      (diluting exactly the behaviour being measured) and it averaged per-shift
      ratios instead of summing the window (complications and discharges do not
      land on the same shifts, so a 3x ward looked average).
- [x] 549 assertions, 37 smoke checks, 12 balance checks.

### Balance, 30 days, seed 90210
| strategy | earned | comp/discharge | insurer | outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| honest   | $21,249 | 0.17 | 0% | Clean, rep 1.00, still broke |
| careless | $22,496 | 10.00 | 99% | Struck off, day 16 |
| careful  | $89,537 | 0.38 | 26% | Tycoon, clean, 2 investigations survived |

The careful line is doing what the brief asked for without being scripted: it
cures a high volume of people quickly to keep the numbers clean, and hides a
small number of profitable outliers inside that volume.

- [x] Physical sabotage verbs: decanting between containers (labels stay put),
      and doorway obstruction that genuinely removes nav cells.
- [x] **Screenshot harness** (`./screenshots.sh`, Xvfb + GL Compatibility).
      Being able to look at the game found five bugs no test could:
      HUD labels wrapping one character per line; the money readout, toasts and
      control hints never drawing at all (zero-size root Control); patients
      standing bolt upright inside their beds; every debt missed on day one
      before the player had done anything; and an eviction failure path whose
      counter was never incremented, making the bankrupt-by-rent ending
      unreachable.
- [x] Career meta: endings unlock starting perks, persisted in user://meta.json.
      Nine perks, each shaped by the ending that grants it. Main menu shows
      careers finished, endings found, and perk selection.
- [x] 595 assertions, 37 smoke checks, 12 balance checks.

- [x] Proximity-scoped subtitles.
- [x] Small talk is no longer rolled (a confidence band on "how are you feeling?"
      was teaching players to distrust the band everywhere it matters).
- [x] **Three departments**, each adding a mechanic rather than a room:
      Emergency (mid-shift arrivals), Radiology (imaging = exact vitals, and a
      permanent record everything must agree with), Psychiatry (recovery driven
      by satisfaction/comfort, patients far more observant).
- [x] 663 assertions, 37 smoke checks, 12 balance checks.

- [x] Upgrade economy rescaled after the harness showed the whole catalogue
      being bought out inside 20 days; two late-game sinks added.
- [x] Thermostats (quiet environmental sabotage with a device log) and chart
      misfiling detection (carrying a chart away is now a real, recoverable
      middle ground between leaving it and shredding it).
- [x] CLAUDE.md with the eight engine gotchas and the load-bearing design rules.
- [x] 671 assertions, 37 smoke checks, 14 balance checks.

### NEXT UP
- Human playtest for feel: movement speed, shift length, prompt clarity.
- A physical second wing (departments are currently capability unlocks that
  reuse the existing floor; new rooms would need Hospital.LAYOUT to become
  data-driven per-run rather than a const).
- More sabotage verbs around the new departments.
