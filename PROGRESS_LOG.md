# BUILD LOG — Chronic Care

> Append-only work log. **If you are a future session picking this up: read the
> "NEXT UP" section at the bottom, then `git log --oneline` to see where things stand.**

Engine: **Godot 4.3** (headless binary validated in-session; project opens in 4.3+).
Validation command:
```
$GODOT --headless --path . --script res://tests/run_tests.gd
```
where `$GODOT` is a Godot 4.3 linux binary (downloaded to the session scratchpad,
not committed — see docs/BUILDING.md).

## Session 1 — 2026-08-19

### Done
- [x] Wiped prior repo contents (owner request), started fresh.
- [x] Project skeleton: `project.godot`, input map, physics layers, `.gitignore`.

- [x] `docs/DESIGN.md` — critique of the brief + the five design changes made.
- [x] Autoloads: Log, RNG (seeded, per-stream), EventBus, DB (content), GameState,
      AudioMgr (fully procedural synthesis — zero audio assets), SaveSystem.
- [x] Core data model: WorldEvent (truth) / PatientChart (record) / Mind+Evidence
      (belief) / Patient / Complication.
- [x] Headless test harness + 118 passing assertions.

### Gotcha found (documented in docs/BUILDING.md)
`preload()` of scripts that reference many `class_name` types deadlocks the
GDScript loader when combined with typed signal params on an autoload. Fixed by
(a) untyping EventBus signal params and (b) using runtime `load()` in the runner.

- [x] Player controller (FPS, crouch, physics shove) + spring-based grab/throw.
- [x] Prop system, 25 items as data, procedural silhouettes, breakage, noise.
- [x] Procedural hospital: 12 rooms (corridor, 5 wards, lobby, nurses' station,
      treatment bay, supply, staff WC, office), two-tone walls with punched
      doorways, hinged physics doors, signage, lights, full furniture pass.
- [x] Custom A* NavGrid (not a baked NavMesh — needs to work headless and be
      seed-reproducible). Integration test proves every room is reachable.
- [x] Fixtures: treatment machines (dial + prescribed value + auditable log +
      invisible calibration sabotage), windows, light switches, EHR terminals,
      shredder, supply shelves, vitals consoles, patient beds (rigid bodies you
      can wheel down the corridor with someone still in them).
- [x] 279 assertions green.

### Gotchas found (both now guarded in the runner / documented)
1. `preload()` + typed autoload signals deadlocks the GDScript loader.
2. Adding a script with a new `class_name` leaves the global class cache stale
   until `--import` runs; run_tests.sh now always does an import pass first.
3. **Calling `.new()` on a script with parse errors HANGS the process** rather
   than erroring. run_tests.gd now gates every instantiation on
   `can_instantiate()`.

- [x] NPC layer: bodies, perception (FOV/LOS/hearing/attention), SuspicionSystem
      (witness routing, corroboration, gossip, complaints, institutional minds,
      statistical inference), Dialogue (barks + conversations with real odds).
- [x] Simulation: PatientSystem, TreatmentSystem, EconomySystem, RecordsSystem,
      InvestigationSystem (incl. covert/undercover), RandomEventSystem, Upgrades,
      Endings, ShiftSystem (full day loop).
- [x] UI: procedural toolkit + HUD + 13 screens (briefing, chart, records
      terminal, dialogue, chart review, shift report, upgrades, tablet, pause,
      tutorial, game over, vitals, treatment).
- [x] Game root wiring, Game.tscn, MainMenu.tscn with run seeds.
- [x] **Headless playthrough test** (`tests/smoke_run.gd`): boots the real scene,
      plays a full shift, exercises sabotage → complication → documentation →
      audit → billing → save/load → day rollover. 37 checks.
      **This caught two real bugs that compilation could not:**
      1. Spawning into `get_tree().current_scene`, which is null whenever the
         game is instantiated into the tree rather than loaded as the scene root
         — silently dropped every patient body and chart.
      2. A ternary that bound to `box_mesh()`'s argument instead of the whole
         expression, passing a Vector3 where a Mesh was expected (null mesh).
- [x] 314 assertions + 37 smoke checks, all green.

### Gotcha #4
Autoload singletons are NOT resolvable at compile time from a `--script` main
loop. `tests/smoke_run.gd` is a thin runner that `load()`s `smoke_impl.gd` at
runtime for exactly this reason.

### NEXT UP
- Playtest-driven tuning pass (difficulty curve, money balance).
- Wire remaining upgrade effects (camera rooms, witness_scale) into perception.
- Codex unlock triggers; more conditions/complications/events.
