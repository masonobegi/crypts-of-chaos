# BUILD LOG — Chronic Care

> Append-only work log. **If you are a future session picking this up: read the
> "NEXT UP" section at the bottom, then `git log --oneline` to see where things stand.**

Engine: **Godot 4.3** (headless binary validated in-session; project opens in 4.3+).
Validation command:
```
$GODOT --headless --path . --script res://tests/run_tests.gd
```
where `$GODOT` is a Godot 4.3 linux binary (downloaded to the session scratchpad,
not committed — see docs/BUILDING.md).

## Session 1 — 2026-08-19

### Done
- [x] Wiped prior repo contents (owner request), started fresh.
- [x] Project skeleton: `project.godot`, input map, physics layers, `.gitignore`.

- [x] `docs/DESIGN.md` — critique of the brief + the five design changes made.
- [x] Autoloads: Log, RNG (seeded, per-stream), EventBus, DB (content), GameState,
      AudioMgr (fully procedural synthesis — zero audio assets), SaveSystem.
- [x] Core data model: WorldEvent (truth) / PatientChart (record) / Mind+Evidence
      (belief) / Patient / Complication.
- [x] Headless test harness + 118 passing assertions.

### Gotcha found (documented in docs/BUILDING.md)
`preload()` of scripts that reference many `class_name` types deadlocks the
GDScript loader when combined with typed signal params on an autoload. Fixed by
(a) untyping EventBus signal params and (b) using runtime `load()` in the runner.

- [x] Player controller (FPS, crouch, physics shove) + spring-based grab/throw.
- [x] Prop system, 25 items as data, procedural silhouettes, breakage, noise.
- [x] Procedural hospital: 12 rooms (corridor, 5 wards, lobby, nurses' station,
      treatment bay, supply, staff WC, office), two-tone walls with punched
      doorways, hinged physics doors, signage, lights, full furniture pass.
- [x] Custom A* NavGrid (not a baked NavMesh — needs to work headless and be
      seed-reproducible). Integration test proves every room is reachable.
- [x] Fixtures: treatment machines (dial + prescribed value + auditable log +
      invisible calibration sabotage), windows, light switches, EHR terminals,
      shredder, supply shelves, vitals consoles, patient beds (rigid bodies you
      can wheel down the corridor with someone still in them).
- [x] 279 assertions green.

### Gotchas found (both now guarded in the runner / documented)
1. `preload()` + typed autoload signals deadlocks the GDScript loader.
2. Adding a script with a new `class_name` leaves the global class cache stale
   until `--import` runs; run_tests.sh now always does an import pass first.
3. **Calling `.new()` on a script with parse errors HANGS the process** rather
   than erroring. run_tests.gd now gates every instantiation on
   `can_instantiate()`.

### NEXT UP
- NPC base + perception (vision cones, LOS, hearing) + memory routing.
- Then: patient system, treatment/recovery, dialogue, economy, shift loop, UI.
